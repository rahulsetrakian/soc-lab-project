## 🌐 Network Design & VLAN Setup

A multi-branch setup with VLANs and router configs was implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

| Branch     | Hostname | Router IP         |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Chennai    | CHE      | 192.168.201.1     |
| Hyderabad  | HYD      | 192.168.202.1     |
| Bangalore  | BAN      | 192.168.203.1     |

🛠 VLANs and switch configurations were simulated and tested for inter-branch communication.

## 🛡️ SIEM & Monitoring – Wazuh Setup

- Wazuh Manager deployed on DC
- Agents installed on all Windows + Linux machines
- Log forwarding and integrity checks configured
- Alerts tested with simulated failed logins and malware detection

## 🔍 Packet Capture & Threat Analysis

- Monitored DHCP, DNS, and SMB traffic
- Analyzed ARP spoofing and ICMP traffic
- Logged suspicious events and correlated with Wazuh alerts
