# soc-lab-project
This is a hands-on cybersecurity lab simulating a small enterprise network. It was built to practice real-world skills required for a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role. The lab is deployed entirely in VMware and uses Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, IIS (web server), and Wazuh as the SIEM/EDR platform.
